Data Insights from AADHAAR A comprehensive Analysis using Qlik:

This project aims to analyze data insights from Aadhar, India's unique identification system, to gain valuable insights into various aspects of society, including demographics, service delivery, and policy effectiveness. The technical architecture involves integrating Aadhar data into the Qlik platform for preprocessing, data modelling, and visualization. The project involves data extraction, data cleaning and transformation, loading the processed data into the Qlik platform, and developing dashboards, reports, and visualizations using Qlik tools. The Aadhaar Card is a 12-digit unique identification number issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI). The analysis uses Qlik Sense to extract actionable insights, including demographic overviews, generation/rejections, and geospatial analyses. The primary data source is the extensive Aadhar database, which includes demographic information, authentication records, and geographical details. The project aims to provide valuable insights into user demographics, authentication trends, and compliance metrics for informed decision-making, enhancing service delivery, and ensuring compliance with regulations.

Data collection is the systematic process of gathering and measuring information on variables of interest to answer research questions, test hypotheses, evaluate outcomes, and generate insights. The data can be downloaded from the provided link. Data preparation is a critical stage in business analytics, where raw data is transformed, cleaned, and organized to make it suitable for analysis. This process involves several steps, including data collection, data cleaning, data transformation, data integration, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data splitting, data documentation, data validation, and data governance and security.

Data collection involves gathering raw data from various sources, such as databases, spreadsheets, APIs, sensors, and social media. Data cleaning involves identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and missing values, while data transformation involves normalizing or standardizing data, aggregating data at different levels of granularity, creating derived variables or features, and handling categorical variables through encoding. Data integration involves combining data from multiple sources into a single dataset, while feature engineering involves creating new features or extracting relevant ones to improve analytical model performance. Data documentation ensures transparency and reproducibility of the analysis, while data validation ensures the dataset meets analysis requirements and business objectives.
In this video the brief explaination of creating  a Qlik Cloud App and how the data is loaded  , preprocessed and detailed explaination on creation of dashboards and story's is available.
Here in this video I created a app named "Aadhaar app" and uploaded the dataset and preprocessed it.Once done with preprocessing the data , I moved ahead and created the sheets (Dashboards) based on various elements and then I created the story based on Dashboards with the help of snapshots that are taken on Dashboards .
